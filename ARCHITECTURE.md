# The project's architecture

TODO

This file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short:
every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is,
the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule
of thumb for ARCHITECTURE — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change.
Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.
